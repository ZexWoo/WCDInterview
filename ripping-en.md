**CD ripping** is a way to extract the music files from a CD. **CD burning** is a way to make a CD from music files.

## LOG FILES

A **log file** is a text file with the file extension “.log”. Like its name suggests, it acts as a log of the entire ripping process and it records any errors that may have occurred. You may not, for any reason, modify a log file. It is strictly against the rules and you will be warned for a very long time. Click [here](/WCDInterview/log-en.md/) to see an example of a log file.

## CUE FILES

A **cue file** is a text file with the file extension “.cue”. Cue files act as a catalog or a table of contents of a CD and allow you to burn a CD identical to an original CD. Click [here](/WCDInterview/cue-en.md/) to see an example of a cue file.

## SUGGESTED CD RIPPING PROGRAMS

What.CD suggests using **Exact Audio Copy** (EAC) on Windows or Linux (with Wine), and **X Lossless Decoder** XLD on macOS. Both EAC and XLD produce high quality rips with sufficient logs to prove that the files are up to standard.
