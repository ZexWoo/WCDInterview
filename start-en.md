## GETTING AN IRC CLIENT

**Internet Relay Chat (IRC)** is a beefier version of chat clients you may be used to, like AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or Yahoo! Messenger.

*Suggested Clients*
- mIRC (Windows)
- X-Chat (Windows, Linux)
- Colloquy (macOS)
- mibbit (web browser)

Once you have downloaded, installed, and set up your IRC client, read on!

## CONNECTING TO WHAT.CD’S IRC

**YOU MAY ONLY INTERVIEW ON YOUR HOME CONNECTION. Proxies, bouncers, shells, office lines, and other non-home connections (including using your friend’s home connection) are not allowed. You may connect from your university dormitory.**

**IRC Server:** irc.what-network.net<br/>
**Port:** 6667 (+6697 for SSL)

After you have connected to What.CD’s IRC network, type: “/join #what.cd-invites” (without the quotation marks) and follow the directions in the topic.

## SPEEDTEST

In order to join the queue, you will have to take a speedtest on your home connection (remember, you may ONLY interview on your HOME CONNECTION!).

If you live at college, please explain this to your interviewer.

1. Go to <http://www.speedtest.net>.
2. Click on “BEGIN TEST” (blue button).
3. Wait for your test to finish.
4. Click on “SHARE THIS RESULT” (green button).
5. Click on the “IMAGE” tab.
6. Click “COPY” (blue button).

## QUEUING

Back in #what.cd-invites, type: “!queue” (without the quotation marks) followed by your speedtest link.

For example, `!queue http://www.speedtest.net/result/12345678.png`

**Important:**
Make sure you are queueing with the correct link and not the “Web” link.<br/>
*Correct:* http://www.speedtest.net/result/1234566.png<br/>
*Wrong:* http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/1234566

Then wait for an interviewer to interview you.

## BUT I’VE WAITED FOREVER!

All of our interviewers are What.CD users who voluntarily interview, so you may have to wait a while before you are interviewed. Although it seems like a lot of interviewers are in the channel, many of them may be “idling” (they are in the channel but are unable to interview).

Feel free to talk to others in #what.cd-invites about anything appropriate, but avoid interview topics and chatting while you are being interviewed.

## MORE QUESTIONS?

Join #what.cd-interviewprep if you have initial or follow-up questions about the interview or the interview process.

**Note: #what.cd-invites and #what.cd-interviewprep are the ONLY channels that you are allowed to join. Other channels are for What.CD users only.**
