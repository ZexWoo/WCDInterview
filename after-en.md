***POSTING THE CONTENTS OF THIS INTERVIEW ANYWHERE OR SHOWING IT TO ANYONE WILL COST YOU YOUR ACCOUNT OR FUTURE INTERVIEWS!***

## YOU PASSED!

Hooray! Nice job answering all of those questions. After you log in, make sure you re-read and follow the Golden Rules. It is helpful to download the What.CD Toolbox (which is freeleech) for programs that most of us use. Then get going! Post in the forums, upload your own CD rips, chat with us in IRC, download music…

## YOU FAILED!

That stinks. Don’t worry, the interview is meant to be educational, which is why you have a total of three tries to pass the interview. Study up on this site and try again after 48 hours (2 days) have passed.

If you have failed three times, you may not interview again. However, you may still be invited by a friend!
